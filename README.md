# Flight Search Application

This is a React-based application for searching flights using the SkyScraper API. Users can search for flights by specifying their departure and destination locations, along with dates for departure and return. The application fetches flight data and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Flight Search**: Users can search for flights by entering the departure and destination airports, as well as the departure and return dates.
- **Flight Results**: Flight options are displayed, including airline logos, flight times, duration, and prices.
- **Price Filter**: A price filter allows users to limit results based on their budget.
- **Flight Details**: Each flight can be expanded to view more detailed information such as flight number and operating airline.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: UI components for building a clean, responsive design.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the SkyScraper API.
- **SkyScraper API**: Provides flight search and airport suggestion functionality.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe coding in the React components.
- **CSS-in-JS (Material-UI `sx`)**: Used for styling components.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-search-app.git
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
